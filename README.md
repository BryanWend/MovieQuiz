# Movie Quiz Game

This game is the final required project from a class at the end of my second year at ASU.  Tasked with creating a trivia quiz game for any movie, series, or game.

## Requirements

Create a quiz style game that allowed for:
* Adding, Editing, and Searching questions from either a file or interface
* Randomized question order
* Basic graphics
* Sound effects (commented out currently)

## Playing

The game automatically loads with a possible pool of 10 questions.  ..\TriviaNow\bin\debug contains a .dat file with the listing of files to load/reload/edit a fresh set of questions.
